# RPG Combat Kata

## Intro

My implementation of the [RPG Combat Kata](http://www.slideshare.net/DanielOjedaLoisel/rpg-combat-kata).

- I had time to code 4 out of the 5 iterations.
- I decided to the lean way, only implementing the absolute minimum for the requested features. That's why for example I don't have a map or battleground where players fight and the "distance" is just unidimensional or I didn't went for a GameEngine or GameEntity abstractions.
- I did TDD all the time, but doing iterations means test contexts sometimes are not perfectly defined (e.g. there are faction-related tests inside their context AND outside in the available actions)

I really liked the kata, despite not having fully finished it.
